	<p id="aboutparagraph1"> I have begun my journey through the depths of the audio industry as a musician. 
	I've always been fascinated by sounds so this was a perfect chance to explore audio from another perspective.</p>
	<p id="aboutparagraph2"> I quickly got hooked. Being able to manipulate audio the way I wanted to achieve the results I wanted seemed like magic. 
	Soon I realized that I wanted to dive a level deeper and expand my knowledge of not only music but also sound as a whole.</p>
	<p id="aboutparagraph3"> After countless of composed pieces, polished tracks and creative experiences this passion remains with me. 
	There is a lot more to learn and a lot more challenges to face. 
	And for this, I am grateful.</p>
